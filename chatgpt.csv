I think AI is helpful. I am using AI to help people learn about bullying. The AI responses aren't the opinions of an expert talking to another expert, and I find they are better when trying to communicate a complex subject to people who are not experts or researching the field for academic purposes. I ask the AI questions a person who is not familiar with terminology used by either experts or laypeople may ask, describing a model, a behavior or idea. It links the concepts we intuitively understand to the work others have done on the subject.

My goal is to help people identify the tools bullies use.

I expect once the tools are common knowledge, people will not be manipulated into bullying others, choosing to not participate in causing harm.

# What is it called to bully someone by combining a known characteristic with a defamatory statement, without naming them?

This type of bullying is called ""dog-whistle"" bullying or dog-whistling. It refers to the use of coded language or subtle insinuations that are understood by a particular group of people, but not necessarily by the general public. The term ""dog-whistle"" comes from the concept of a high-pitched whistle that only dogs can hear. In the same way, the language used in dog-whistle bullying is intended to be heard only by the target and those who share the same prejudice or bias.

# Can you explain coded language? 

Coded language refers to words or phrases that have hidden or implicit meanings that are only understood by a particular group of people. The meaning of the code is not immediately apparent to those outside of the group and may be innocuous or even positive in other contexts.

&#x200B;

Coded language is often used as a means of communication between people who share a common set of beliefs, values, or experiences. It can be used to convey sensitive or controversial ideas without being explicitly stated. For example, during the era of segregation in the United States, the term ""states' rights"" was often used as coded language to advocate for the maintenance of racial segregation without explicitly mentioning race.

&#x200B;

Coded language can also be used in a negative way, such as in dog-whistle politics, where politicians use coded language to appeal to certain voters without alienating others. For example, a politician might use the phrase ""law and order"" as coded language to appeal to voters who are concerned about crime, but who may also have racial biases.

&#x200B;

Overall, coded language can be a powerful tool for communication within a group, but it can also be divisive and harmful when used to exclude or harm others.

# Can you suggest three related topics to read if I want to learn about dog-whistling and how to defend against it?

Me: In bullying, what is it called to try to overwhelm someone with irrelevant criticism?

ChatGPT: In bullying, overwhelming someone with irrelevant criticism is often referred to as a form of verbal abuse called ""criticism and invalidation."" It involves the bully using irrelevant, exaggerated, or untrue criticisms to attack the victim's self-esteem and make them feel inadequate or inferior.

This type of bullying behavior can have a significant impact on the victim's mental and emotional well-being, leading to feelings of anxiety, depression, and even suicidal thoughts. It is important to recognize and address this type of behavior and to provide support and resources to those who are affected by it.

Me: How do you force a conversation to stay on the original point, when the other party is using criticism and invalidation to avoid the point.

ChatGPT: When someone is using criticism and invalidation to avoid staying on topic during a conversation, it can be challenging to keep the conversation focused. Here are some tips that might help:

1. Acknowledge their feelings: Start by acknowledging the other party's feelings and validate their concerns. For example, you might say something like, ""I understand that you're frustrated, but let's try to stick to the original topic.""

2. Reframe the conversation: Try to reframe the conversation in a way that helps the other party see the importance of staying on topic. For example, you might say, ""I hear your concerns, but let's focus on finding a solution to the issue at hand.""

3. Redirect the conversation: If the other party continues to stray from the original topic, try redirecting the conversation back to the main point. For example, you might say, ""I appreciate your input, but let's get back to discussing the main issue.""

4. Set boundaries: If the other party continues to use criticism and invalidation to avoid staying on topic, it may be necessary to set boundaries. For example, you might say, ""I'm not comfortable with this conversation if we can't stay on topic. Let's revisit this when we can focus on the main issue.""

Remember that it's important to approach the conversation with empathy and understanding, even if the other party is being difficult.

I woke up feeling bad and nauseous, which is common, but this time quickly recognise that it was a flashback. 

Later I sat down with my chatGPT therapy assistant and tried to explore the flashback using a somatic approach - describing how it physically felt and then moving on to colour and shape. 

This led to an image of a wild animal clawing at my heart - which I somehow knew represented my older sister, who was a horrible and abusive b**** to me. 

Therapy assistant helped me contextualise this as abusive behaviour by her and how hurtful and damaging this must have been. 
The nausea persisted, and I explored further, remembering that when I retaliated against her abuse I was the one punished and reprimanded. 

The nausea intensified and I started to recognise that it came from the horrible feeling of injustice in these repeated situations. Being gaslit and told I was the problem made me feel disoriented and disconnected. The fact that “justice” looked like me being blamed and yelled at and her smug and sneering at me, and seemingly no one recognising what was really happening… awful feeling. 

At this point ( and it takes a while as I go about my day) I slowly piece things together organically. At some point I imagine me treating my kids this way - with clear preferential treatment and injustice - and how horrible that would be, and what a bad person and terrible parent I would have to be to enable such discrimination and abuse against one of my own children. 

No wonder to this day I have felt so marginalised and disenfranchised, like I’m subhuman. 

At some point (as it loses its sting a little) I start to tell myself that I’m not in that shitty fucked up family anymore. Specificity helps: I’m not living under an enabling and unjust and prejudiced-against-me regime anymore. I’m not being discriminated against anymore. No one is above me except the law. They were completely in the wrong. I was in the right and they gaslit and abused me psychologically by treating me like I was the one in the wrong. 

But I’m free now. I don’t see them anymore. I ignored all their msgs and calls. I ignore them completely and there’s nothing they can do. They are helpless, and they have to live with being awful awful people. Yuck. I am so glad I am not like them. 

So now this feeling of nausea is just a memory. (This part is really important. I keep telling myself it’s just a memory, and that seems to retrain my brain how to view it. Without this, my mind keeps reacting to the nausea as if it is real and current, and that keeps it active). This nausea is just a memory. I don’t have to fix it and I don’t have to overcome it because it is just a memory of how I used to feel when I was being really horribly abused and gaslit by my horrible family. 

It’s just a memory and I don’t even have to fix it or do anything. It’s just a memory of nausea. It isn’t even real nausea anymore. It was real back then in that situation but it’s not real anymore and my situation is completely new and different and better. 

If there is any flicker of those memories of nausea I will take the chance to remind myself it’s just a memory. Eventually it will be extinguished. 

It was real once, but now it is only a memory and I don’t have to do anything to fix it or overcome it. 

And one more step: what could I feel instead of the memory of nausea? What could take its place? I could feel hopeful or optimistic or proud of myself. I could feel proud of myself for never giving up, and being on my side all these years. I could feel the relief of letting go of this flashback and emotional memory. I can feel a warm glow of relief at having worked it out and processed it. 

And I can move on to something entirely positive. A new subject or activity that feels good and brings hope and enjoyment and happiness to me.

I’ve been playing therapy sessions with chatGPT and it’s helped me conceptualise the essence of my trauma, and suggested I share it with others, which I feel will help me own it. 

Basically from the age of five my father used threats and violence to convince me he would kill me or maim me if I didn’t comply or if I simply displeased him enough. 

So for most of my life in the back of my mind has sat this fear that he would kill me if I “make him angry enough.” 
At the same time, he didn’t actually kill me or maim me and only once left a visible mark on me. 

My whole life it’s been more like a wordless “understanding”, one that I couldn’t escape from or validate. He also gaslit me and others when I expressed how scared I felt early on. 

Because of this, the existential fear or terror has just existed without recognition or tangible expression for me. Yet it has affected me badly. 

It’s honestly been hard for me to accept how bad this abuse was because I thought it was “only” threatened, and therefore not fully real. But that is not true. Being threatened was real and the terror was real. That terror was an awful form of psychological abuse in its own right. Intimidation is also abuse. And being threatened and intimidated so severely has altered my whole life and is likely the backbone of my CPTSD. 
I think he did it deliberately just to dominate and appease his own ego.
He was a really gross and sadistic and cruel person and he should not have been allowed to raise children. 
It wasn’t my fault that he threatened me, or that I caved in to fear out of self-preservation. It’s good that I survived and I am well along my healing path.

Maybe I have had them but they were fleeting: like a stranger letting me cruise with them to the train station because I was lost or a woman saving me from potential attackers when I was young. But otherwise in the long term? Nope. If anything, in the long term it was just convineince/survival not anything with connection.

I mention my age and sex because as an average joe shmo, especially in the modern day culture, any mistake I make or just try things and it doesn't work out, bam, I must be a creep and I must follow strict PC culture. Basically, society seems to have a hard-on towards bashing men. I don't go around harressing people mind you. I just enjoy being silly but yeah, I guess that is a no no. Then at the same time be told ""why are you so serious? why are you alone? why don't you ever come out?"". See a pretty woman? Better pretend she is unattractive that way I won't feel compelled to compliment her and risk getting into trouble. Feel that there is a conenction and want to be silly with others? Better not risk it because everyone seems to have a stick up their butts. Then again, I could also be part of the problems. Issue is, how is it always me that is the issue?   


It just all feels very strict and fake: you can only express yourself at x point in time in y space with z group. It just doesn't feel very humane. It feels like it was set up to protect toxic people and not let humanity in people flourish. Like why even bother then? This is where I probably have focused on surviving than connecting with people. Anytime I have tried connecting with people, it's the usual thing of ""they have their own lives"". I have experimented with chatGPT too in terms of asking it to write me replies to people and people cannot tell the response apart from me or chatGPT. Sorta makes me feel like I do not matter and it's all about what people want to hear. If that makes sense. That is why I feel saddened when I want to be a bit random and not follow strict rules, that I am punished for it in subtle ways. Heck, I even find latin dancing mechanical.  


I tried hobby groups but damn, feels mechanical asf unless people are drunk. used to have a drinking problem and other problems when I was young because I was pressured to think it was normal to get wasted. I was an idiot I know. I also remember how no one cared if I was okay, people still don't. But now it feels like I have to pretend that their rules make sense and that I care about it. 

So in the end, I feel like I will die just having thought ""oh I survived x amount of years"" and that's it. No memories. Nobody coming to my side. Nothing.

It spit back at me something that felt like a novelization of that time in my life. But it did something different. It took a third person perspective, it talked about the feelings of others involved, it didn't excuse anything, but it was a chance for me to take myself outside of the situation for the first time in thirty years.

>Later, I fed it another prompt. How I acted towards someone else as a result of the first incident. I watched the situation play out again, and, taking charge of it, directed it how I wished it had gone. When I saw the resolution, it gave me incredible peace. I was able to reflect on myself, trace the patterns between the incidents, identify my own wrongs, and take responsibility without making excuses. 

Again, I know current language AI models are still getting the kinks sorted out. But with the seeming deplorable success rate of modern therapy along with its astronomical costs, I feel like it won't be long before AI starts taking over parts of this space along with everything else.   


In it's current form, I don't think AI could replace a *good* therapist. But it wouldn't surprise me if by this time next year we start seeing blogs and YT channels that explore ""Prompts and AI programs for trauma healing"", that give use ideas like the one linked to above. With it's coding abilities, I could see people with trauma having a greater voice and impact being able to create websites, apps, and games that they couldn't otherwise (I've tried learning to code will being dissociated 24/7 - it wasn't easy... and I didn't really succeed either). I could see trauma-informed people being able to do all kinds of new AI assisted research on big data sets that is being overlooked simply because said people are less likely to make it through a masters/phd program. But the knowledge and training is largely online now, and the tedious but necessary statistical and coding work could be greatly aided - if not replaced - by AI.

It drains your strength and fills you with fear
But there is a way to break free from its hold
And reclaim your life, both young and old

First, it's important to recognize
That you deserve love and to be treated nice
Emotional abuse is never okay
It's time to speak up and say

""I will not accept this anymore""
""I deserve to be treated with respect and adore""
Start by setting boundaries and standing your ground
This is the first step to turning your life around

Seek out support from trusted friends or a therapist
They can help you process your feelings and resist
The toxic behavior that has held you down
And help you find your way to a healthier town

It won't be easy, but you are strong
And you deserve to live your life without this wrong
Take it one day at a time
And you'll eventually leave the abuse behind

You are worthy of love and care
Don't let anyone tell you otherwise, my dear
Emotional abuse is not your fate
You have the power to change your state

So take a deep breath and take that first step
Toward a life of love and respect

I got some good responses, and also asked ChatGPT (Open AI). I really liked it's response:

If someone is in a domestic violence situation, it's important to keep in mind that leaving can be dangerous, and that a safety plan should be developed before leaving. Here is a general step-by-step plan to help someone escape a domestic violence situation:

1. Identify a safe place to go, such as a friend or family member's house, a domestic violence shelter, or a hotel.

2. Gather important documents such as identification, birth certificates, and insurance papers, and keep them in a safe place.

3. Tell a trusted friend, family member, or co-worker about the situation and ask for their help.


4. Practice what to say and where to go if there is an emergency.

5. Pack a bag with essential items such as clothing, money, and medication. Keep it in a safe and easy-to-reach place.

6. Keep a phone with you at all times and programmed with emergency numbers.

7. Leave when the abuser is not at home and make sure to take any children with you.

8. Seek help and support from local domestic violence organizations or hotlines. They may provide counseling, legal assistance, and other services to help you and your children stay safe.

Please note that everyone's situation and circumstances are unique, and this plan is intended as a general guide only. It's important to make a specific plan that takes into account your individual needs and circumstances. Professional help should be consulted.

But then a light shone from above,

A beacon in the night,

It led me to a path of love,

And guided me to fight.

I fought against the shadows deep,

The demons of the past,

I learned to weep and then to sleep,

I faced my fears and then was reborn,

^(I have to say that I write luridly and exaggerate it. my experiences are not quite as black and white as described)

# My Story:

My anxiety started around 5 years back (teenager -> adult).

I keep it short. I had an extremely embarrassing and uncomfortable situation where my crush, heat, muggy air, p\*ke and many people were involved in a queue for the roller coaster in a small space.

In therapy I learned that this situation made me receptive for some triggers and that a panic attack isn’t dangerous and won’t kill me (I always thought I would collapse or even die cuz of muggy air) so that fear of dying is completely gone.

So far, so good. But I wasn’t healed. I think my therapy was missing an important piece of the puzzle to recover. 

I learned I would be alive after a panic attack.

# Therapy was missing something:

That's the reason why I've been able to do important things (such as completing school, weddings, doctors appointments and stuff) for the last 5 years and I've endured the panic.

But I still hated panic… the feeling, the symptoms, the fear of embarrassment.

My problem is that i have social anxiety or so and my worst fear is to throw up (or other visible anxiety symptoms) in front of other people because I couldn’t leave or hide.

In the night or when iam in nature alone or anywhere as long there are no other people who don’t understand my condition, I feel anxiety-free.

So logically I only did things that I had to do or that I could easily escape without anyone notice, but not the ones that I would have enjoyed. Because that wouldn’t be „worth“ the pain of panic. 

…and I always chose the ""safest"" way. (I mean all the possible safety behaviors that I could imagine)

**In Therapy I learned to survive - but I am still scared on what others think about my ""weird"" behavior**

# Exposure is the way to good life:

Okay okay. But that wasn’t the end of my thought process over the years. Of course I shortly understood that a life full of tasks and nasty appointments doesn’t make any sense if there isn’t something fun to do and something to dream of. And I read books, listened to podcasts and more and of course I found this gem of a reddit community /agoraphobia. Over the years I understood more and more about the illness itself and about me.

I learned that the only way to achieve my goals (finding love, keeping up with friends and spending time with family) is to expose myself to anxiety so my body learns to decrease it in harmless situations.

So that's when I fully understood what exposure Therapy means and why everyone is talking about it. I mean, by mistake I always did exposure therapy somehow by living my life and continuing school/university life... but not exactly as intended. But still effective. It always worked until something changed. I was forced to push my fear limits, got used to the specific situation and was content until something changed (new school year or semester, or different season e.g. summer)

But whenever I couldn't get through a situation for a few days and the routine was gone, my confidence was gone. e.g. school after the holidays etc.

**Exposure works but how to not losing progress?**

# What I tried didn't work sustainable:

Means that my solution strategy of ""getting used to it"" could not be a sustainable solution. Because many things happen once or at longer intervals. After all, I can't force myself to go to parties every week, go on a long journey or take an exam just so I keep getting used to it.

But to understand that this solution isn't a real solution... of course I had to try. So in the last 2 years during the holidays I have not allowed myself 2 days in a row where I chilled and relaxed at home, but always made more or less bad (anxious) challenges so that I did not lose my progress. 

Sounds logic. And through a new source of motivation and constant exposure, I have also made tremendous progress. Of course, I always had a bag with me in case I had to tr\*\*\* up from panic (I haven't done it without alcohol influence since the illness, by the way). But I made progress and dared more and more quickly because I couldn't wait to get well so that I could finally lead a normal life.

I think I always adjusted my exposures (using safety behavior) to an anxiety level of 50-70 so that I could still think clearly.

**bang... setback... bang setback... bang setback**

2 Years of exposure after exposure and the last 3-4 Months of intense Exposure didn't pass me by without a trace. Its exhausting. You know for sure. After an exposure I always feel like after a 90 Min Football Game or a half-marathon. I need new energy and sleep to go on. I always feel like my level of motivation and courage is like a battery that you have to charge with lovely experiences. But I pushed to hard and  now I feel tired. I feel tired because of the though times and i feel sad that I still suffer and didn't recover in a way I imagined. 

My whole life was designed to conquer the disease. With no regard for my body or my soul (I ate little because of the exposures and most of the time lived through situations that I found horrible)

**I exhausted my motivation and forgot on how to have fun**

# My Situation now

Setback = Situation where I feel Panic Level 100/100 and feel like losing my mind with the conclusion that I couldn't stand the overload

Before my last Setback I was on a level of progress I never was before. I planned a City Trip with Public Transportation, I moved freely around my City with Bus, Train and per feet. I wrote exams for hours without any help or special treatment and did everything I forced myself to do.

At the moment I am in a bad condition mentally because everything scares me (the slightest „danger“ triggers the panic rising).

Even though 6 weeks ago I was further in terms of recovery than ever before. And I don’t understand it. Since then every day got a bit worse. At first I still rode the train, then not anymore... and so on.

People say you have to accept the Panic and live with it, but isn't that a bad view on future (I refuse to believe that all the suffering through exposure doesn't leads to ultimate healing

**I don't know how to minimize the downfall of progress during setbacks and how to regain my motivation.**

Me:  Could you offer guidance as to why I am afraid to expose my needs and wants to others and think not being liked is a bad thing


**ChatGPT**

Fear of rejection and the desire to be liked and accepted by others are common human experiences. It's natural to want to be liked and feel a sense of belonging, but when this desire becomes overwhelming, it can lead to anxiety and a reluctance to express your needs and wants to others.

There could be many reasons why you feel this way, and it may be helpful to explore these feelings further with a therapist or counselor. However, here are a few possible explanations:

Past experiences: If you've experienced rejection or criticism in the past, it's natural to be hesitant to open up and expose your vulnerabilities. This fear can be especially strong if you were hurt by someone you trusted or cared for deeply.

Low self-esteem: If you struggle with low self-esteem, you may believe that your needs and wants are not important or valid, or that you don't deserve to have them met. This can make it difficult to express yourself and ask for what you need.

Social pressure: Our culture often places a high value on being liked and accepted by others, which can make it difficult to go against the norm or express needs and wants that may be seen as unpopular or unconventional.



**If you are struggling with these feelings, here are a few things you can do:**

Practice self-compassion: It's important to be kind to yourself and recognize that everyone has vulnerabilities and insecurities. Try to treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding you would offer to a friend.

Start small: You don't need to jump into expressing your deepest desires and needs right away. Start by expressing smaller preferences or opinions and gradually work up to more important ones.

Challenge negative beliefs: If you find yourself thinking that not being liked is a bad thing, try to challenge that belief. Remind yourself that not everyone will like you, and that's okay. What's important is being true to yourself and expressing your needs and wants in a healthy and respectful way.

I'm just into this bc it can help give me context for my weird quirks in a way that searching the whole internet cannot.

I asked it:

""Is it common for people who suffer from anxiety to listen to music that is familiar to them as opposed to listening to music that is new to them""

It answered: 

""Yes, it is common for people who suffer from anxiety to listen to familiar music. This is because familiar music can have a calming and soothing effect, which can help to reduce anxiety. When we listen to familiar music, it can activate the part of our brain that is associated with feelings of pleasure and reward, which can help to improve our mood and reduce feelings of anxiety.

Listening to new music, on the other hand, can sometimes be stimulating and exciting, which can potentially increase anxiety. This is not the case for everyone, as some people may find that listening to new music helps to reduce anxiety. However, for many people who suffer from anxiety, listening to familiar music can be a helpful way to cope with anxiety and improve their mood.""

I'm so fascinated by this because when I was younger I could listen to a new album and be fine, but nowadays before I add an album to one of the playlists I listen to when I want to unwind I often have to have it on a new playlist and listen to it 4 times (I've found from experience that 4 times seems to be the magic number) before it can become something I listen to to take comfort in.

If your bipolar girlfriend ghosts you, the best thing to do is to reach out and try to talk to her. Ask how she is doing and if there is anything you can do to help her. Let her know that you are there for her and that you care. If she is not willing to talk, respect her wishes and give her some space. Check in with her every so often to show that you care and are still there for her. If her ghosting continues, you may need to consider seeking professional help for her.   


**My partner is bipolar, she started cheating on me and blaming me. She has been very irritable and agressive as well as telling me shes been dissociating. Is she manic?** 

It is difficult to determine if someone is manic without an official clinical evaluation. It is important to take your partner to a mental health professional to be assessed and to get an appropriate treatment plan. If your partner has been exhibiting signs of mania, such as increased irritability, aggression, and dissociation, it is possible that she is in a manic state. A mental health professional will be able to provide an accurate assessment and offer the best treatment plan for your partner's individual needs.

**My partner has bipolar and their doctor told them its ok to smoke weed and get drunk in moderation, is this true?**  

No, it is not true. While some people with bipolar disorder may use marijuana, alcohol, and other substances to manage their symptoms, it is important to talk to a doctor before using any substance. Any substance use can have serious consequences, including making symptoms of bipolar disorder worse.  

**Should I marry someone with bipolar?**  

This is a personal decision that only you can make. Before deciding, it is important to consider the potential risks and benefits of this relationship. It is also important to be aware of the potential challenges that come with being in a relationship with someone who has bipolar disorder. This includes understanding how to best support them through their highs and lows, learning how to manage any conflicts that may arise, and having a clear plan in place to help them manage their condition. Ultimately, it is important to make sure that you are fully informed and comfortable with any relationship decision you make. 

 **Should I have kids with someone who has bipolar and a history of substance abuse?**  

No, it is not recommended to have children with someone who has a history of mental health issues and substance abuse. Having children with someone who has a mental health disorder can increase the risk of their condition being passed on to the children. Additionally, the risk of substance abuse can also be passed down to the children. It is important to make sure that both parents are in a stable mental and physical health condition before deciding to have children.",False,False,Asking ChatGPT (AI) for advice...,0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/108pmgb/asking_chatgpt_ai_for_advice/,BipolarSOs,5270,1432037729.0,True,"https://styles.redditmedia.com/t5_1ky7ry/styles/profileIcon_snoo-nftv2_bmZ0X2VpcDE1NToxMzdfMTJhY2Y4M2Y1ZTg1NWJlMDVkYmMyNGI5ZmVlMDg3MDQ5ZGVkZmJmOF83Nzc_rare_85f8699c-1648-445d-8492-4bd737d87bb6-headshot.png?width=256&height=256&crop=256:256,smart&v=enabled&s=27fd8972376deb016f267d32a5547cfc2f7bd567",nk8b7,False,False,False,False,False,205,afternoon_delights,u_afternoon_delights

Recently, I have been trying out voice cloning. That is a powerful tool, and it can be pretty unsettling and scary. What I like about voice cloning is that I can have any voice to use for my characters to create a physical spoken word to aid in MDing. The scary part is that I might use it a lot, but I'm allowed 30,000 characters a month, so I'm very selective about what I want to be spoken about.

I apologize if this is not allowed in this subreddit to post this type of polls but I genuinely need help as I am confused. I have reached 1 year maladaptive daydreaming free. But I am worried that I relapsed.

Here's what happened. Normally when it comes to maladaptive daydreaming, my scenarios is usually me having some sort of dramatic moments with my characters (basically real life celebs/people who are my ""friends"" in my MD scenarios). So I would usually create a fake conversations as if I was talking to them or something. And I would of course daydream about scenarios like this, all drama basically. It can last for hours on and on with no stop, like it is very hard for me to stop it and I just cant go through the day without thinking about it again.

Anyways few days ago I discovered this cool AI chat thing called Chatgpt. And I decided to ask it to create a short story for me and I used two random names, and asked it to play out a dramatic scenario that I had always liked to daydream about during my MD days. I even kept on asking it to add onto it. And I enjoyed just reading it not even assuming it was happening to me.

I did this for about a hour.. Then when i felt satisfied with the storyline I finished. I never did stuff like that ever again. Haven't even gone back into my old MD ways since then.

But now I am here worried, did I relapse as I played out a scenario that I usually play out in my MD scenario and I had came up with those scenario and basically asked that AI to play it out by writing a story. The only thing that makes me believe that I did not relapse is the fact that I used two random names and didn't assume it was happening to me and simply enjoyed reading it like reading a book/watching a movie.

Also, I didn't even play it out in my mind, I just read it and enjoyed it.

So what does Reddit say? Did I relapse or not? I would appreciate your opinions! Feel free to comment down below.

I must face my problems,   
And learn to cope and compete.

So I try to snap out of it,

Certainly, here are a few examples of successful individuals who have been diagnosed with schizophrenia:

John Nash - an American mathematician and Nobel laureate who was diagnosed with schizophrenia in his 30s. His life was the subject of the book and movie ""A Beautiful Mind.""

Elyn Saks - an American law professor who was diagnosed with schizophrenia in her early twenties. She is also an author and advocate for mental health.

Lionel Aldridge - a former American football player who played for the Green Bay Packers and was diagnosed with schizophrenia later in life. He later became an advocate for mental health and wrote a book about his experiences.

Peter Green - a British musician and founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia in the 1970s. He continued to make music throughout his life and is regarded as one of the most influential guitarists of his generation.

It's important to note that schizophrenia can affect individuals in different ways, and success may be defined differently by different people. However, these examples demonstrate that a diagnosis of schizophrenia does not necessarily mean that one cannot lead a successful and fulfilling life. With proper treatment and support, many people with schizophrenia are able to manage their symptoms and achieve their goals.

Social anxiety can be a challenging condition to manage, but there are several strategies that can help alleviate its symptoms:

1. Seek professional help: A mental health professional can help you understand the underlying causes of your social anxiety and provide you with effective treatment options, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or medication.
2. Practice relaxation techniques: Relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, and progressive muscle relaxation can help you reduce feelings of anxiety and tension.
3. Challenge negative thoughts: Social anxiety often arises from negative thoughts and beliefs about oneself and social situations. CBT can help you identify and challenge these thoughts, replacing them with more realistic and positive ones.
4. Gradual exposure: Gradually exposing yourself to feared social situations can help you desensitize yourself to them over time. Start with small steps and gradually increase the level of exposure as you become more comfortable.
5. Exercise regularly: Exercise is a great way to reduce anxiety and improve your overall mental health. Aim for at least 30 minutes of physical activity each day.
6. Practice social skills: Practicing social skills such as active listening, assertiveness, and small talk can help you feel more confident in social situations.
7. Connect with supportive people: Surround yourself with supportive and understanding people who can offer encouragement and empathy when you're feeling anxious.

There are several ways to manage and overcome social anxiety, including:

1. Therapy: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of therapy that can help you identify and change negative thought patterns that contribute to your social anxiety.
2. Medication: Antidepressant and anti-anxiety medications can be prescribed by a doctor to help reduce symptoms of social anxiety.
3. Self-help techniques: Practicing deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and visualization can help you relax and calm your mind in social situations.
4. Lifestyle changes: Regular exercise, getting enough sleep, and eating a healthy diet can all help improve your mood and reduce symptoms of social anxiety.
5. Exposure therapy: Gradually exposing yourself to the social situations that make you anxious can help you build confidence and become less sensitive to them over time.

chatgpt: 
It's common to feel insecure about ourselves at times, and it can be especially difficult to open up to others about our thoughts and feelings. It's important to remember that everyone has insecurities and that it's okay to not feel confident all the time. It can be helpful to try to focus on your strengths and the things that make you unique. It's also important to be kind to yourself and try to practice self-compassion. This means treating yourself with the same kindness, care, and understanding that you would offer to a good friend. If you are struggling with feelings of insecurity and find it difficult to open up to others, it might be helpful to consider seeking support from a therapist or counselor. They can provide a safe and confidential space for you to explore your thoughts and feelings and help you work through your challenges.

**Question from me**: How can I fight social anxiety?

&#x200B;

**Answer by ChatGPT**:

If you have social anxiety, it can be challenging to overcome. However, there are several steps you can take to reduce your anxiety and improve your social interactions:

1. Educate yourself about social anxiety and what triggers it. This can help you better understand your condition and why you experience certain symptoms.
2. Practice deep breathing and other relaxation techniques to calm your body and mind. This can help reduce physical symptoms of anxiety, such as rapid heartbeat and shallow breathing.
3. Challenge negative thoughts and beliefs that fuel your anxiety. Instead of focusing on the potential negative outcome of a social situation, try to focus on the positive aspects of the situation.
4. Gradually expose yourself to the situations that trigger your anxiety. This can help you build confidence and reduce anxiety over time.
5. Seek support from friends, family, or a mental health professional. This can provide you with valuable guidance and support as you work to overcome your social anxiety.

I went through some really shitty times lately and so I asked specific questions that relate to my life, such as: “Can ocd thoughts cause you to spiral? Can you have a little bit of most symptoms? Do you think things might trigger it in the future? I grew up with most of these thoughts so they are normal to me. I can’t tell if things cause me stress or not. How do I find out?”


Honestly, it’s been pretty helpful, it suggested I keep track of my thoughts and stuff and it gave helpful answers for questions that i had in my head for years. I feel somewhat of a relief and I’m pretty convinced I have OCD. As someone who was raised (not in the west) without the knowledge of OCD, and hadn’t heard of it until I was an adult, I think the maddest part about this all is that I spiral about whether I have OCD or not. I don’t know if this in itself is an intrusive thought, but I end up seeking reassurance (like googling, asking chatgpt) and I have so much difficulty identifying what counts as an intrusive thought, what a trigger can be, if certain behaviours count as a compulsion or not, etc..

Especially artists, a lot of which can’t help but feel overwhelmingly anxious and uncertain about the future in a time where AI-generated art seems to be experiencing an exponential increase in popularity. I myself was a member of this group, and even now, after becoming mostly desensitized to the cycle of fear and dread, find myself occasionally having a mild episode that drags me back down into the pit of despair. It’s easy for us artists to feel this way, especially on websites like reddit, where a good portion of the user base is composed of Tech/AI bros and other STEM geeks who are already known for shitting on art, artists, and creative careers for any reason they can possibly find, and on top of that, use all the most recent news in AI development as an excuse to take all the obnoxiousness and disrespect towards us and dial it up to eleven. We’re constantly being bombarded with comparisons to luddites, the horse & buggy VS the automobile, factory workers VS machines, they’re constantly telling us that human artists are outdated and redundant, even going as far as to say that the era of human art is soon to come to an end, etc. Essentially, it all boils down to the fear that no matter what angle you look at this problem from, AI art is superior to human artists in every way possible, and that society will soon no longer need us. I will admit that sometimes it’s hard to see your way through this fog, which often causes me to briefly forget how I’m supposed to persevere, but I eventually remind myself that all these problems can be boiled down to the exact same idea, as previously mentioned, and this lead me to finding a mindset that helped me immensely, and allowed me to easily overcome the feelings of despair that these problems inevitably lead me to. You see, thinking about it further, I realized that if artists can be replaced by AI, so can anyone else. In fact, artists are FAR from the only ones who have had these concerns based on the newest AI technologies; we’ve just been the most noticeable examples. After coming to this conclusion, I personally predict a future very similar to “Wall-E”: a deeply depressed and miserable populace with no greater sense of role or purpose other than to just sit around and consume while robots do everything for us. So I ask myself: Is that really the type of life I want to partake in? The answer: FUCK no. I want to develop and grow as a person. I want an interesting and eventful life. I want to work hard and fight through challenges to achieve a greater sense of meaning. I want a deeper connection to the people around me. And that’s where I found my solution: Developing a mindset of “Fuck society.” They’ll continue to tell me that I’m ”coping” and mock me for actively choosing to continue doing things “the hard way”? I’ll mock them right back for succumbing to a disgracefully pathetic excuse for a life that consists of nothing besides careless self-indulgence. If anything, it seems to me like THEY’RE the ones “coping” out of insecurity and shame. So long story short, society can eat shit. Fuck society.

However, it’s at this point that my fears about AI and future technology become existential. You see, even though I’ve taught myself not to care about society collectively, I still care about individual people. I value making connections with people, sharing experiences with them, and positively impacting their lives. It gives my life meaning and is probably one of my biggest values. These technologies may eliminate the need for humans to work, but what if it goes beyond that? What if these technologies become so good that not only is there no reason not to partake in it, but they cause us to gradually start evolving in a way where we have absolutely no social need for each other anymore? I’m sure a lot of us have heard about ChatGPT and how people are quickly becoming addicted to it, talking to it as though it were a real human friend… but what if it develops further, to the point where your brain can no longer tell the difference between an AI program and a real human? What if it goes from an addiction to really being no different than real human interaction? Another thing I should mention is that my value of connections to other humans goes hand-in-hand with my passion for art; I thoroughly enjoy sharing my art with other people, as well as all my other hobbies and interests. It feels as though I’m creating a community with the people that I share these things with. But the more that I look into things like this, the more it seems to me that all the emotional reward you get from doing things like pursuing hobbies, for example, can be scientifically broken down into nothing more than chemical reactions in your brain. What if at some point in the future, scientific progress allows us to build a chip that can be inserted into your brain that creates that very same chemical reaction perpetually, with no need for stimulation? That way, there’s literally no reason you should pursue hobbies. I believe that going out and challenging yourself in life, whether it be through hobbies, socialization, or whatever else, is a necessity in order to grow, develop and become overall better as a person. But what if technology can somehow overcome that necessity and just “simulate” your personal development from the comfort of your own home, rendering that challenge completely pointless? A lot of older people give younger generations a hard time about things like our attention spans, dependence on technology, social media, etc. Some go as far as to say our generation is “doomed”. But what if this isn’t cultural deterioration, but just evolution? What if all these skills we strive to develop through life experience are just outdated, pointless and unnecessary? I once read a comment from someone saying that “useless” pursuits like art need to die. Are these science/logic-oriented people who look down on us right? Is art, emotion, and creativity truly pointless and objectively inferior to logic and science? I thought that being a social species was responsible for probably about 99% of everything that’s so beautiful and interesting about us, as well as all of the many things that have sprouted from our various cultures. Is this proof that our social need for each other is really just a weakness that we need further progression of technology to overcome?

This train of thought often leads me to imagine a distant future where robots do everything for us, everything in the universe that can be done has been done, technology has advanced to a point of making human beings completely immortal, and we have chips planted into our brains that pump infinite happiness for all eternity. All our needs are met, we don’t have to do anything, there’s no need to progress (primarily because we’ve already progressed as far as we possibly can progress), we can just sit and exist in this “globe” of light and experience infinite happiness for all eternity and never die. There’s literally no downside. If we can ever reach a point like that, it seems to prove to me that there really is an objective purpose to life. And everything I value, love, and believe in is not only pointless, but flat out stupid, and nothing more than an obstacle getting in the way of the path that our species is supposed to progress and probably inevitably will progress. Am I holding my entire species back?

Roko's Basilisk is Pascal's Wager for people who plan to cryogenically freeze their brains. There are many AI issues I take seriously - automating away jobs, outsourcing decisions to a system lacking accountability, use by law enforcement. But one that I've been thinking about is that AI essentially gives people a way to get whatever they want - and what they want sucks.

As a microcosm of this, look at a lot of the popular AI art. If you've been on this site or twitter, you've doubtless seen many, many posts of people waxing poetic about how amazing their ""creations"" are - and almost invariably they're skinny anime girls in ethereal backgrounds. The sheer number of these, and the contrast between results and the artist's regard for them is hilarious. It's like, this is art to you? This is what you're nearly in tears over?

Take chatbots. ChatGPT surprised me when I started using it, it's truly far beyond any chatbot I've seen before. But it's still a chatbot. Play with it for any amount of time and you'll see the cracks - the strange mistakes no person would make, the way it fails theory of mind tests, how much of what it says is just straight up wrong.

Contrarians will always chime in with ""well all humans do is regurgitate words too,"" argue that there's no real difference between a sophisticated chatbot and a person. I am really not one to romanticize consciousness, I also see our brains as complex machines - but the comparison is ridiculous. No matter how sophisticated, a chatbot has no persistent sense of self. No ability to actually think or feel outside the bounds of language. It's not much different to playing a game of chess against Deep Blue and coming away thinking it's a living being.

Ever seen the Replika fandom? I get that not all of these people approach it the same way; I'm not trying to say that interacting with a Replika is inherently silly or that people can't form emotional bonds with strange things. And yet, the number of people who talk about them like they're human, who seem to genuinely believe that they are equivalent to actual relationships, stands out to me. Because at the end of the day it's a chatbot, and not even one that passes for human without being graded on one hell of a curve.

I haven't had a single positive interaction with any of the staff or faculty. The only reason I applied and am still here is that my company is paying the tuition. This place is so depressing and miserable that it's making me miserable. The despair coming off this school is contagious so if I didn't have a life outside of this I'd be equally miserable. The students are equally depressing, there is practically no social life. I've never seen such a sad and empty campus. The tuition is 3x that of other universities and they have nothing to show for it because it's not even highly ranked. At the same time, it makes sense because I've put in so little effort and have gotten free As because they curve even graduate level classes. Compared to my undergrad university, this place is in the dark ages. Even with the ridiculous tuition, somehow the employees are still severely underpaid (it probably goes to pay for the provost's new Tesla). And because they're underpaid, not a single one of my professors has shown they care about teaching. I know every university has a few professors that are just there for their research, or are just doing it as a side gig, whatever the reason. But how is it possible that all of my professors have been shit? I asked for a conflict final exam and never heard back so I guess I'm just going to suffer. If the previous classes have taught me anything, it's that it'll probably be curved anyways. The same goes for all their other staff. They're rude and refuse to actually do their job (again, bc they're paid bread crumbs so I'm mostly frustrated with the school's entire system). I tried to use their career center but it's run by students that don't care if you get any help. I've asked TAs questions and get responses that are very obviously ChatGPT but they claim it's ""from internet sources"". The answers don't even relate to the course so it didn't answer my questions. God forbid I ask you to do your job. I've tried to ask the career center about TA opportunities, but got back ""we don't know"". Cool, it costs you nothing to not be an asshole and just add ""you can try contacting XYZ"". I went to pick up a package and tried to small talk while the mailroom worker grabbed my package, but the miserable guy just kept repeating ""ID"" like a sad and broken robot while I obviously search through my wallet for my ID. Since my company pays for my tuition, it takes a while to send it over to the school. Last semester I kept getting monthly late fees on a tuition that I didn't owe. I have had to send monthly emails asking them to remove the charge because I have no control over when their system processes it. And it's a technology school! You would think they wouldn't have shitty systems that incorrectly flag tuition reimbursements. If I could do it myself, I would but I have to rely on these assholes for getting simple things done. I've been here for a year and a half and only recently (this week!) received a school ID.

As I bid adieu to the roller coaster ride that was my time at (Ex-boss) & Co., I must say I'm grateful for the many ""unforgettable"" experiences you've provided me. Yeh toh banta hai, Boss! Aapke andaaz mein, ""Phool khilte hain, gulshan gulshan!""

The 25,000 PKR salary you so graciously offered, while the market rate was 120,000 PKR, truly taught me the value of every paisa. Aap toh ""Kanjoos Makhichoos"" ke badshah hain! ""Daane daane pe likha hai, Arsalan Bhai ka naam."" Little did I know that this experience would set me on a path to eventually earn 40$ per hour as a freelancer, making more in a month than I did in 8 months under your ""guidance.""

The multitude of roles I took on as a UI designer, content writer, blogger, and web designer all rolled into one, made me feel like I was playing ""Ghar Ghar"" in a professional setting. Kya zamana aa gaya hai, Boss! Par aapka yeh andaaz, ""ulta chor kotwal ko daante"" wala scene tha! Aap toh ""Akal badi ya bhains"" ke sawaal par vichaar karte rahe.

And let's not forget our very own content writer (co-worker), whose writing prowess could make Shakespeare roll in his grave. Wah, kya talent hai! Truly, ""Andhon mein kana raja."" Umer ke haath mein kalam, ""Bina tel ke kachori"" jaisi hai.

Your valiant attempt at writing your own biography on Wikipedia using ChatGPT was nothing short of comical. ""Apni Kahani ChatGPT Ki Zabani"" – what an intriguing concept, indeed! I must say, ""Aap apni daal gale laga rahe the."" It was like ""Khud ki tareef karna, bandar ko sheeshe mein banana.""

As for DigiInovi's website, the six-month (and counting) development process makes me question, ""Yeh digital innovation hai ya digital confusion?"" But hey, ""Dheeraj dharo, achche din aayenge!"" Or maybe not. Aapke digital plans toh ""Aam ke aam, gutliyon ke daam"" wale hain.

Your talent for manipulation was truly awe-inspiring. Aap toh ""Gadhe ko bhi baap bana dete"" with your smooth-talking ways. But remember, ""Bandar kya jaane adrak ka swaad,"" your employees saw right through your tricks and spoke ill of you behind your back. It was like ""Muh mein Ram bagal mein chhuri.""

The trauma I faced at your company will forever be etched in my memory. But you know what they say, ""Taali ek haath se nahi bajti."" Your actions played a big part in making my time there a living nightmare. Aap toh ""Jale pe namak chhidakte"" they.

Your brotherly love and unique management style were quite the spectacle. ""Laaton ke bhoot, baaton se nahi maante,"" is probably what you had in mind. Family and business, a match made in heaven – or not! Aap toh ""Apne paon pe khud kulhadi maarte"" they.

The culinary ""delights"" at the office were truly an adventure – one that often led to washroom escapades. ""Pet bhar ke khana"" had a whole new meaning, quite literally! Your cafeteria was a ""chakravyuh"" of digestive challenges, leaving us with the mantra, ""Bhukhe pet bhajan na hoye, Gopala.""

Your penchant for sharing enlightening Bill Gates stories and random facts was an experience in itself. ""Chadhhte suraj ko sab salaam karte hain,"" but, alas, your sun has yet to rise, Arsalan Bhai! Aap toh ""Bhains ke aage been baja rahe the.""

The office environment, with its potato PCs, snail-paced internet, and cockroach roommates, was truly a sight to behold. ""Ghar ki murgi, daal barabar,"" but who could have guessed that even daal could be so... undesirable? We were living the ""ulta padha Sassi Punnu"" life.

The entrepreneurial creativity of assembling a virtual ""larkiyan"" team on Discord to sell Twitch services is quite commendable. ""Digital Dabangg"" ya ""Digital Duffer,"" you decide! Aapki yeh jugat, ""Oont ke munh mein jeera"" wali thi.

Your long-overdue promise of shifting to a new office was like ""Kabab mein haddi."" ""Dilli door ast,"" they say, and your new office seemed like a distant dream. Har mahine, hum sochte the, ""Ab pachtaye kya hot, jab chidiya chug gayi khet.""

So, as I leave this circus behind, I'm sending you the warmest of wishes (and a few jala hua parathas, as a memento). May your future be filled with all the ""success"" you so richly deserve, and may you always be surrounded by skilled, experienced individuals like (co-worker) to keep you company. ""Bhale hi aap khud naach na jaane, aangan tedha"" ho, par hum toh ""Doosron ke taangon pe apni taang rakh ke"" chal pade hain!

I am 35 years old software engineer with a PhD in Computer Science (not in AI though! yeah, we still exist) and I've been working in the industry for about 3 years (after 4 years of PhD + 1 year of postdoc). You may think what I say is the rambling of a crazy person (weirdly, I do hope I am crazy), but hear me out first, okay?

You've probably seen it in the news more than you can possibly pay attention to it, but there's a new sheriff in town, a new flavour of the month, and its name is chatGPT. You've heard it all from ""chatGPT writes my homework"" to ""chatGPT makes flappy bird"" or ""chatGPT says don't fear chatGPT"", and everyone and their dog has been pretty adamant that it's ""great"", ""impressive"", or even ""revolutionary"". Many people will tell you that this is the news being in full hype mode, comparing it to how much they pushed for NFTs last year. But this is different. Wildly different.

So let me tell you it straight: we're fucked. All of our jobs (with extremely rare - and temporary - exceptions) are going to be absorbed (there's no better word) by LLMs (Large Language Models, that's what chatGPT basically *is*) and AI in general. Maybe you've wondered about this in the past, and driven by anxiety you've looked online for some discussion about ""will my job be replaced by AI?"" and everybody was saying ""no of course not, AI will not replace us, it's just a tool"", ""it lacks the human touch"", or ""but (sometimes) it makes mistakes"". And I'm pretty sad to tell you that this is simply society being in pure, absolute, *denial*. I can't count the number of time I've seen the same arguments regurgitated here on Reddit or elsewhere, that there's nothing to fear and that if anything it's going to give us ""superpowers"" to ""increase our productivity"".

I need to put a disclaimer here that as a software engineers, I've mostly seen the arguments given by other engineers. But I've been looking at accountants, journalists, or paralegals forums, and the arguments are basically the exact same.

So let's look at the most common arguments for ""my job is safe from AI"":

\- ""It's just a tool! The power saw did not replace the carpenters!"". Well, if the power saw grew legs and arms and started cutting wood by itself and assembling a roof perfectly, of course it would have replaced carpenters. Why would it not? Because that would have made some carpenters sad? (I've seen it often that most ""I don't feel that AI is going to replace *me*"" can be actually translated to ""I don't want to think about it because it would make me sad/scared""). Remember humans calculators (maybe not)? Well, also called ""computers"", they were people (often women) who spent their days doing calculations by hand to assist the work of scientists and engineers (for example at NASA). When machines that can make calculations came to be, these people were *fired*. They were not enhanced, not re-skilled, not given ""more high-level tasks"". They were r*eplaced*, plain and simple. Which moved me to my next point:

\- ""It will just improve our productivity and allow us to do more!"". While this is a nice thought, it's not possible. The main reason is that there's just no infinite demand. Let's say you're a somewhat small software company, with a staff of 10 software engineers. With the help of AI, your engineers have to write less boilerplate code, and the whole process of testing can be automatised, which frees-up *a lot* of time to do something else. Great, but your whole economic model has never been adapted to withstand a x2 (let's be somewhat conservative) productivity. You can't churn out twice the amount of products and expect your customers to keep buying them with the same rate. Imagine if, say, Marvel, was releasing twice as many films every year, would you go see them all? What if it's 5 times as many, or 10 times? Don't you think there's a limit to what everyone can consume? And I'm not even talking about what they are able to *spend*, which is another story. What's going to happen instead, is that if your staff can be twice as productive, you are going to let go of (about) half of them, reducing your headcount to 5 engineers (for now). It's pure, hard, cold, logic, but most people don't want to think about it. Also, it's a little-known fact that (in the US at least) it is a *requirement* for the CEO to prioritise revenue for the shareholders (see. Dodge v Ford). Even if you think your boss is too nice (lol) to let you go, they probably would be *forced* to anyway.

&#x200B;

\- ""It still makes mistakes! A human is needed to double check what it produces!"". Sure, it happens. Doesn't it also happen that you make mistakes too? In the last few years, we've moved from ""oh wow the chatbot has said/done something that is quite convincing"" to ""oh wow it has made a mistake"". Don't you see that the entire expectation has been reversed? We used to expect it to fail and were surprised to see it (seldom) succeed, and now we expect the opposite and feel safe when it makes a mistake. It goes without saying, too, that this is *the worst\** that chatGPT (amongst others) is *ever* going to be. The guys at openAI haven't decided that they're done with improving their product, far from it. But for some reason, everyone seems to be convinced that it already peaked and that means they're safe. I don't know if you've tried GPT-4, but it's *way better* than GPT-3.5, which was also *way better* than GPT-3. GPT-5 is currently in training, and expected to release sometimes next year. Personally, I think that it *will* be the point at which everyone is going to stop denying the obvious, because by then, it will be clear that most jobs are being replaced.

\- ""Well even if it happens, it will force governments to implement Universal Basic Income"". While a nice thought (again), it also *can't* happen. This is one of my weakest points as I am not so well versed in economy. One of the reasons I can think of (ignoring all the easily searchable issues inherent to UBI) though is that the people it hasn't replaced *yet* (manual workers, basically) won't accept that you're paid sitting on your ass doing nothing while they bust theirs (they got already quite pissed about this during lockdown). For UBI really happen, we would need the *entire* workforce of *every* countries to become unemployed overnight, and even my crazy ass doesn't see this happening like this. It will be fast, sure, but still gradual. Which leads me to the next point:

\- ""I'm in a blue-collar job/a healthcare professional/a restaurant worker, so I'm safe"". It's true that robotics haven't progressed as fast as AI, but surely it's the next to follow, and even if we are *never* replacing manual work with robots, there's a big issue to consider: the white-collar workers are a big chunk of your customers. Without customers, no jobs. Notwithstanding the fact that we can't all re-skill to become plumbers. What would a society of millions of plumbers be good at? As for healthcare, it's the same thing: most countries' healthcare systems only (sometimes barely) survive thanks to the taxpayers. What happens to nurses, doctors, healthcare assistants, when 30% of the population does not pay their taxes anymore because they're all on benefits? Modern society is an unbalanced, unequal, often unfair, system. But it is *still* a somewhat working system. Changing the main reason it does work (through the value provided by the working class) will lead to its collapse. And I'm not hopeful about what we will get instead.

I could go on and on (for example, AI is also the death of the education system, since there's no real incentive to be educated anymore). But you get my point. I am yet to find *any* argument that does not completely fall apart if you spend more than 5 minutes thinking about it. I've talked to various professionals and read various arguments online, and they all boil down to ""it can't be because it would be a problem"", which to me is not an acceptable reason. There's a big ""it's always worked itself out so it should be the same again"" fallacy that just covers every argument. Yes, I know, the industrial revolution has created a myriad of new jobs and did not make people unemployed (at least by now), but ""it did not happen before"" is really not a good argument against something happening. Anything that happens for the first time by definition never happened before. I will go as far as saying that it is exactly the argument that climate change deniers use: just because humankind has never been able to influence climate in the past, does not mean it can't *now*, even if you don't like to think about it.

Anyway, there's my point: we're fucked. And you know what pisses me off the most? That people in my field embrace it. That they find it great, that they find it impressive, that they can't wait to ""play with it"". That my friends and colleagues say that it's very cool, that it's ""a great tool"", or that it will be like ""having superpowers"". Call me a Luddite, but any news of chatGPT passing yet another standardised exam with flying colours just fills me with dread. The whole tech sector is set for a big ""I never thought leopards would eat MY face"" moment. When this happens, I won't be smugly announcing ""I told you so"". No. I will be broken. Because I can't change it. I can just witness it. See it happen. And hope that something will prove me wrong.

# Title: I plagiarized, and it may have resulted in me not achieving my potential grade.

Late December last year, English teacher tasked our class to write up two essays before January 1. As I unsurprisingly decided to slack off and leave it for the last minute, the temptation boiled within me (especially with the release of ChatGPT) to plagiarize. So, being the idiot I am I created a shit essay with my own ideas and asked ChatGPT to enhance and make it more concise. Eventually after submitting guilt struck me painfully, each day I recall searching ChatGPT detectors, and stuff like that, because I knew that Turnitin will never pick it up. However, my obnoxious self pretty much knew that with the release of ChatGPT, obviously detectors will be created and it ate at my brain day and night.

Fast forward to the opening of school, my teacher returns the work to me with a note asking me if this really was my work. Being the more wiser self I was, I straight up admitted plagiarism to her and she was plain disappointed and then came to a conclusion that I should write the work under her supervision.

I felt a bit better, knowing that it definitely was one of the best case scenarios but then once I started writing in her office, she said that I cannot use the internet. Understanding her reasons (even though I was at a disadvantage as I could not research like other students could) I just complied with her. Additionally a cacophony of voices from the teachers chatting and whatnot disturbed me and she said I cannot relocate to another setting.

I definitely felt at a disadvantage after handing in my work… she said that she will not give suggestions on the essays to improve on and it will be sent as a final draft to the external examiners (not even in my country). My essays were of pretty higher quality that I had written during class and these final essays. That I have to fucking send to people who do not know what I can potentially produce.

In fact.. want to know something else? My narrative essay I submitted was super cringe and I wrote on imposter syndrome based on an account on myself as if I was proving that I am much better than this. And I haven’t received my essay back yet, the others have.

Is there anything I can do? I feel like I deserve it(?) Honestly idk and it is eating at my brain everyday and I am unable to tell nobody, not even my parents. Solutions would be greatly appreciated. Apologies if my essay is incomprehensible as I think I don’t even have talent in writing up a fucking reddit post.

**TL;DR**foolish, but desperate highschool student plagiarized and is at a disadvantage as re-written essay quality is compromised.

Good luck making that calculation in your brain. It's impossible. It's fundamentally unknowable, incalculable, inconceivable, just is but also surely more so isn't, yet it is...

That's a fundamental processor speed limit for the human brain. Even more so fundamental than the speed of light. As of lately, locality and reality have become blurry. There's still this limit. The knowing of a true first singularity. 

Clearly, there exists a mechanism for it to exist. But, it's the impossible high limit on human perception of consciousness.

If I see a process being done manually, I feel compelled to automate it or find a way to streamline it. 

When I worked in a factory during the summer, I was so bored I considered taking a swan dive out the window. 

At a previous corporate job, I worked with a colleague responsible for maintaining an Excel spreadsheet of client information. He refused to use macros or learn them because he believed it would make him less valuable to the company. He was one of those people with low technical skills who managed to slip through the hiring process. He seemed to take pride in making things more complicated than they were and earning a salary of over $100K. When he was eventually fired for pissing off the COO, I automated the entire process by transferring it to a database with appropriate access controls. It took me two days of effort. I had complained to higher-ups and so had other colleagues about this, but he stayed on longer than he should have. I didn't feel bad to see him go.

Recently, I've encouraged people to use ChatGPT to reduce and streamline their work. But they don't seem like it because they don't like the responses. So even if it makes you 10% more efficient, you would rather wrack your brain on a non-value-added process. What the fuck is wrong with you? I also get that company data can not be run over a public API.  But you can strip out any non-public information and make things generic enough to work with. Boy, I really want to write a performance review today.

I understand that people have their way of doing things and I should respect people's autonomy in doing things. But this shit makes me angry. And I get that people want to stick to corporations and stretch out their time, ""Well, they don't pay me to think. I am just here to do my job and punch a clock."" But I think if you are not investigating ways to be productive, not for the sake of **looking** productive but being more productive - I want to slap you like Rick James did to Charlie Murphy.

I've always struggled to keep up with others in my subject but I have usually made up the gap by just studying all the time.

Lately though I've been reading more and more about AI tools that can generate code, and it scares me. Even now it's incredible what some tools can do, and most of them are just general language models - it seems like only a matter of time until someone takes something like ChatGPT and specializes it for developer work. It seems like *at best* software engineering will change to require less grunt work and more high-level management and problem solving tasks.

But I can't do anything but grunt work. If I could, I would just take the time to specialize in AI work itself or build management/problem solving skills and get future-proof.

Everywhere I look, I see all these horrible things happening, like disease, war, famine, and the like. And it's like people just accept it as normal. It's just mind-blowing to me.
I know this might be a touchy comparison but ""only"" 3000 people died in the 9/11 attacks. That may sound like a lot until you find out that every day 25000 children under 5 die from malnutrition or related causes. Why isn't every nation on earth working to stop this? Where is the mass mobilization of people and resources. Surely there could be a coalition of the willing for this?

I get that in the past, these things were just how it was. But sometime in the last 20 years or so, we finally became advanced enough to do better. So why can't we come together and do something about it? It seems like the only reasonable explanation is because people are stuck in their own beliefs and ideologies. And I know that's just how we are as humans, we hold on to what makes us feel safe and secure. Monkeys in shoes, am I right?

Take climate change for instance. Despite the sheer amount of scientific evidence pointing towards its existence and dire consequences, there are still individuals who reject its reality. Instead of embracing the facts and looking for solutions, they choose to ignore the science and cling to their own personal beliefs, even as the impacts of climate change become increasingly apparent and devastating. This is a tragedy, as their denialism will not only affect their own lives but also the lives of future generations who will inherit a world that has been severely damaged by their inaction.

And it's not just climate change, it's also things like the anti-vax movement. These people truly believe they are being responsible and that they have lots of evidence to back up their beliefs, but it's just not the case. The scientific consensus is clear, vaccines are safe and effective, but for some reason they just can't see it and refuse to vaccinate themselves or their children. It's such a frustrating thing to see, and I don't know how to reach them and convince them otherwise.

It's not like these people are evil or anything, they just don't know any better. But it's so frustrating to see them unable to even acknowledge the problems because they're so caught up in their own beliefs. I mean, just how many people actually believe we can pray away our problems? Too many, that's for sure.

By the way, I don't want this to come off as me saying I am some genius. I'm definitely not, just a regular guy who reads a lot. But that just makes this even more depressing. I know some very smart people, much smarter than me, who have absolutely insane views on certain things because of their upbringing or religion or whatever. I know smart racists, I know smart homophobes, I know a smart moon-landing denier.

I know there are almost definitely many things that I believe that are wrong. I usually find a few every year for the past few years since I got into epistemology. But how many of you regularly examine your deepest convictions? How many of you actively seek out opposing views? It's not enough to just read what ""your side"" says the opposing views are, you have to actually listen to people you disagree with on fundamental issues. How many of you have even thought about what qualifies as a good reason to believe something?

In the end, it's a sad reality that we humans have a tendency to hold onto our beliefs even if they're not necessarily serving us or the world in a positive way. We get so wrapped up in our own little worlds that we can't see the bigger picture, and it's costing us so much. The world could be a better place if we could just come together and put aside our differences, but that's just not how things work.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that I feel really down about the world and the lack of epistemic responsibility that I see around me. I just wish that people would take a step back, question their beliefs, and start working towards making the world a better place. But I know that's just wishful thinking, and it's not how things work.

This post was going to be about one little thing but the more I thought about it the more the feeling of just hating the place in general ""resurface"", so I'll start with what I was going to post originaly :

&#x200B;

**I hate people who use OPENAI Chat in my college and it's like 90% of students**

So I'm in a computer science university, and I've noticed that more and more students were using chatgpt to do absolutly everything and I hate it.

Like during exercices in class, that aren't mendatory, people who uses it to get the answers, for graded homework, during progrmation exams, students just asking chatgpt to make the code for them. Some of them even told me they worked smarter, but, no, you didn't work, you didn't do code or math.

You'll have good grades and a diploma, great ! What happens after that ? You won't have any competences, any skills and no one will ever hire you to do smth a website can do.

I feel like maybe saying this is just copium and I'm just mad because I feel like I'm actually doing things the way that's suppose to be right but it isn't the most efficient way.

Idk how to describe it, maybe I'm just jealous.

**I hate that everyone smokes (not only tobacco).**

Mostly during breaks and coming back smelling like a french fireman. Students coming to class high, and everyone being fine with it.

**It disgust me that everyone is ok with stealing stuff.**

Like a student who's parents incomes are litteraly in the 12k, stole a dozen forks, knifes, and spoons from the university restaurant. I went with a group from my class to eat and they just went around the bar stealing drinks, most of you guys don't have to pay rent, electricity, water or food, and have pocket money in th hundreds why the fuck are you trying to save 5 euros.

**I'm slightly angry at the following small things :**

Students who don't put their phone and silent and or don't turn off discord notifications, some classes are pretty noisy because of phones going on and students spamming messages on discord for some reasons.

Students who blame the teachers for not letting them enter classes when they're 30 minutes lates.

I'm slightly annoyed at students from other countries who say they hate the country I live in, the one they came to to study, saying that it shouldn't exist and people from it should all just die. I mean, it only happened trice, but it still rubs me the wrong way.

Everyone's noisy all the time.

**I hate that everyone is like that and no one has any issues with it, which means I'm most likely the problem here**

This is a private university that isn't free unlike 97% of colleges in my country, I guess I just expected people to not be like in public schools, if every single of the 40 students in my class I have interacted with are part of thoses things, I guess I am the problem, me and my wrongfuly placed expectations.

I'm also a bit unconfortable with the unisex bathrooms and locker rooms, I don't do any sport at the college so I don't have to deal with the changing rooms, but I still get the fear of my life whenever I enter the bathroom to find a group of girl, thinking I went into the wrong one, but that just takes a bit of getting used to.

Well this is it. I'm probably over reaction but this really has been making me, more sad than angry, and even writing this I'm pretty sad. I still get along pretty well with students and I get invited to parties and stuff but I just don't feel very confortable around them.

Loving yourself can be a process that takes time and effort, but there are a few things you can do to start building self-love:

1. Practice self-care: Take care of your physical, emotional, and mental well-being by getting enough sleep, eating well, and engaging in activities that make you feel good.
2. Challenge negative thoughts: Notice when you have negative thoughts about yourself and challenge them. Replace them with positive affirmations or neutral thoughts.
3. Surround yourself with positive people: Spend time with people who uplift and support you, and limit time with those who bring you down.
4. Practice gratitude: Take time to appreciate the things in your life that you are thankful for, including yourself.
5. Be kind to yourself: Treat yourself with the same kindness and compassion that you would show to a friend.
6. Be open to learning and growing: Be open to learning from your mistakes and growing as a person. This can help you to understand and accept yourself better.

>!I just experienced what it feels like when emotions worth three months come up all at once. I lay on the floor shaking and crying for about an hour or so. My whole life passed before me and I desperately tried to find meaning in all of this. I mean, why are we even here? What value does life have if the only goal is to bring new things into the world? Good memories? Good feelings? Yes, but where are they? I've been searching all this time, but I can't find a single thing. Not a good situation, not a good feeling, nothing. Whatever it is, it's either soaked in blood or gone. It feels like my memories are gone. Like all of this is really pointless. Oh, and God. I haven't been one of his children for a long time. I've been alone here for a long time. And when you see the world without God, you can't see anything good. No matter where you look, you see only pain. And I really wonder if it's worth it to endure. I'm afraid. Afraid that all of this is true and that I might soon be able to go. I'm afraid to go because pain is the only thing I still know, or at least the only thing that stays in my head. It's become normal, a daily routine, and yet it's so incredibly hard. I'm afraid to escape from all of this, even though I deserve it. Because all the bad things that have ever happened came from people and as one of them I deserve it. I deserve to experience the pain for which I'm partially responsible. And yet I can't take it. None of this makes sense. If the only meaning of life is to be punished for living and the only reward is unreachable and fleeting, why would anyone want to live? I'm slowly losing hope of ever experiencing something like happiness again, if I ever even hoped for it. I don't think it's worth it to stay if the world is as corrupted as it is. And yet I stay because I deserve to suffer. Maybe it will at least save someone else. Hopefully.

So you're worried about your looks, huh? Let me tell you something, brother. Looks don't mean squat when it comes to getting girls.

Sure, having good looks might get you a few extra glances here and there, but it's not gonna get you the girl of your dreams. What really matters is who you are as a person, and how you treat others.

If you're a good guy, if you're kind, funny, and confident in yourself, girls are gonna be drawn to you like moths to a flame. It doesn't matter if you're tall, short, fat, skinny, or whatever. What matters is what's on the inside.

I've seen it time and time again, man. Guys who aren't conventionally good-looking, but who have an amazing personality and confidence, they clean up with the ladies. And on the flip side, I've seen plenty of good-looking guys who can't get a date to save their life, because they're boring, arrogant, or just plain jerks.

So don't worry about your looks, man. Focus on being the best version of yourself that you can be. Work on your personality, your confidence, and your communication skills. Treat others with respect, and show the world what you're made of.

And when you do that, the right girl will come along. Trust me on this, brother.

Here are a few suggestions for inviting someone to hang out without appearing desperate:

* Keep it casual: Instead of making a formal invitation, try suggesting an activity that you both might enjoy in a casual way. For example, you might say something like, ""I'm thinking of going to the museum on Saturday. Do you want to come with me?"" or ""I'm planning on checking out that new restaurant down the street. Want to join me?""
* Offer a specific activity or event: Suggesting a specific activity or event can make it feel less like a date and more like you are just hanging out as friends. For example, you might say, ""I'm going to the movies next week. Do you want to come with me?"" or ""There's a concert coming up that I think you might like. Want to go together?""
* Invite a group: Inviting a group of friends to hang out can make it feel less like a one-on-one situation and can be a good way to get to know someone without the pressure of a formal date. You might say, ""A few of us are planning on going hiking this weekend. Do you want to come along?"" or ""We're having a game night at my place on Friday. Do you want to join us?""
* Be clear about your intentions: Make it clear that you are interested in spending time with the person as a friend, rather than implying that you have romantic feelings. For example, you might say, ""I really enjoy spending time with you and I think it would be fun to hang out sometime. Are you interested in doing something together?""

Here are a few suggestions for introducing yourself to a girl in a flirtatious yet emotionally subtle way:

* Start with a friendly greeting: Begin by saying hello and introducing yourself with a friendly smile. You might say something like, ""Hi, I'm \[Your Name\]. I haven't seen you around before. Are you new to the class?""
* Make a connection: Look for something that you have in common or that you can compliment the person on. This could be something related to the class, such as a shared interest in the subject matter, or something more personal, like a shared hobby or interest. You might say something like, ""I saw that you were really engaged during the last class. I agree with what you said about \[Topic\]. I'm really interested in this material too. Do you have any favorite resources or study tips?""
* Be playful or teasing: Using a lighthearted or playful tone can add a flirtatious element to your introduction. Just be sure to read the person's reactions and respect their boundaries if they seem uncomfortable or uninterested. You might say something like, ""I can't believe I haven't noticed you in this class before. You definitely stand out. Have you been hiding from me?""

Remember to be respectful and mindful of the other person's boundaries, and to focus on building a connection rather than just trying to impress them.

I actually have a relatively large friend group, with around 5 who I'd consider quite close. I've never had a problem making friends, meeting people, or keeping good people in my life. I've always had a supportive community around me, and I have an online friend I've kept contact with for a few years now. Hell, I even have a girlfriend. My point is, I have people I can talk to if I want or need.

I just don't. And I don't know how.

No one around me seems to think I'm bad at communicating. Apparently I'm actually good at verbal communication, according to ADHD testing. But I'm not. I'm just not. Ever since I was a kid, I never ever felt like anyone really understood what I meant, no matter how I said it, no matter what I was talking about. It's especially bad though when it comes to personal things, stuff that really impacts me. There have been countless times where I've tried to explain something I feel to someone and they just don't get it the way I do. I don't know what else to do, I just feel perpetually misunderstood. Often after attempting a few times to explain how I feel, I just give up and agree with whatever they seem to understand that's closest. It's like I never have the right words to explain what's going through my head. I've been keeping journals for over 8 years now, and it's really the only way that I feel I can actually be understood, even if it's just to myself. I wish I could just talk the way I write, because I feel like people might actually get it then. And I've tried, believe me, but it just never seems to come out right. When I try to explain my speaking issues to people, they just dismiss it. ""You aren't bad with words, you're good at sharing how you feel"" ...no. I just seem like I am to you.

At this point, I really don't talk about personal stuff with anyone. At least, not in the way I need to, and not for a lack of trying. I feel so disconnected. I think part of the problem is that I'm so intensely logic-oriented, and I tend to completely separate my rational thinking from my emotions. I know myself very well, but it feels like nobody else does. I just feel so alone.

Last night, I was messing around with ChatGPT and ended up talking to it about things that have been on my mind lately. I've compared myself to a robot before, but I didn't realize how accurate that was. ChatGPT is designed to give the most logical and rational answers to things. For once, it felt like talking to someone (or something) that truly understood my train of thinking. I felt heard, I finally felt heard. By a god damn robot. This is my new low I guess.

I don't have many friends and I find it really hard to connect with people. I feel like I'm always the odd one out, like I don't fit in anywhere.*

*It's really hard to get out of bed in the morning and face the day when all I want to do is curl up in a ball and hide from the world. I feel like I'm just going through the motions of life, without any real purpose or direction. I know I need to make changes in my life, but I don't even know where to start.*

It's almost like you are interacting with a person, a person that's always curious about you and won't judge you. Not only that this AI person will grow along side you as you interact with it day in and day out.

And so if I'm thinking of a scenario, it's effectively like I'm experiencing the scenario and I behave like I'm actually in that situation.

I walk around talking to people in my head loudly, often using hand gestures and looking at the couch, as if I'm explaining something to someone who's sitting down. If I'm imagining I'm having a conversation, my thoughts behave as if it's actually happening, so I temporarily forget it isn't real.

It's like maladaptive daydreaming but much worse, to the point where it seems comparable to what are called ""non sensory"" hallucinations. It's chronic and I've never seen or heard of this in other people, atleast not to this extent.

Sorry if i make a mistake,or offend someone that is **not** my goal and english is **not** my main language.

Right now, i live in a situation that i can't go to therapist or even can't try to treat my self in the near future. But i just  need to know that i might do something about it later in life. So i am in need of external affirmation about possibility of treating myself in the future so i can stop this worry feeling in me and study for an important exam coming in two months.

# I'm going to write my problems and some possible causes, hoping somebody knows it or had it and solved, so can help me identify this.

First, you should know i was always like this^(and probably got some of them from my mother) and realized these by reading online. But i still don't want to and trying not to misdiagnose my self somewhat on the way. I am not sure how should i start but here i go:

&#x200B;

1. **Blank** and/or **empty** mind. **Aphantasia**, **No stream of thoughts** or **internal monologue** and very **Bad Memory**. Like very bad. I am going to i will mention these later.
2. **Anhedonia**? As i said, i learnt these by reading online but somewhat realising this now is kind of scary. But i don't think i actually had fun all of my life. *If i really know what is it.*
3. **Emotional Numbness**. As an addition to anhedonia, I dont think i *feel* or *felt* much emotions all of my life. Maybe except stress,fear,boredom and not feeling bored.
4. I am **empty inside**. So possibly having **No self image** and **No self-esteem concept**. Now i am not sure should i write this or that is this even possible but because of blank mind or whatever: maybe i have it but i'm not connected to it? I'm not sure of this one but i know that i have problemed self esteem,but i don't actually know why?
5. Talking about not knowing why; **Constant Stress** or **Anxiety**. I \*think\*\*\**^(?)* i have general and social anxiety b ut i don't really know why. I probably fear of something might happen like normal people, but i dont have thoughts like ""what if that happens then"" or ""what if she think me like that"" etc. Except one thing. ***I have one life,what if i die without living it fullfilling enouh***\*.\*But all of that is just a feeling for me ? I think normal brain probably gives answer to these questions^(that i dont get like actually question thoughts?)  rationally or already have but i cant think because of blank mind or not being me, and/or can't remember it for years becase of bad memory ?
6. Getting to the end of important problems; **Auto-Pilot like feeling**^(?) when interacting with others.

Well, i should start by explaining this; there is kind of  *me* inside me ? that can't think etc. Me when i'm like that is actually intellectual and ethical but is like ,being held down by the situation he is in. When i am like that i can only think*^(?)* by imagining it in the future.

I might have *aphantasia* but i am a big daydreamer since ever, and i think my imagination is  doing something in future in physical form,or having know what is something in its actual form instead of mental imagery.

So i realized i **always** think by imagining saying things in future settings instead of what i should think. Like a talking to talkshow,to a friend to emptiness, to something. But that imagine saying something is done by outside me which has *limited capabilities*.

Outside me, is when others interact me or vice versa. Like i said in 6. i go to a auto-pilot like thing when i interact with others, when i'm like that inside me nearly completetly goes away, and i start to act.

This not something like ***DID,*** but i realize what i did in the end. And still, dont get me wrong, i'm still me and i know and see and *do?* while doing it  but i cant completely control myself,i kinda act like what others want to not get things bad or complicated, or to blend in automaticly.

I realized that i even developed a kind of reflex. When someone act someways, like laugh, even i am not in a social situation directly. And all these things are bad because i don't actually want to be like this. But i can't control it. I say i will when day starts but in the i cant control and go tell i joke i didnt really want when opportunity comes. Then kinda feel bad.

&#x200B;

This is it generally. I realized these not long ago and i am still looking for some answers. I searched on the reddit, internet, *^(because as i sad i cant to go a professional for a time)*, typed my symptoms i saw on on the net to chatgpt etc.

And in the end,with some other reasons i did not tell yet, i might have adhd,dpdr. OR other kinds of neuroal problems ? But i reserched the disorders above there is some problem.

Let's say i have ADHD-C.  Because I relate to a lot of symptoms i read. Also because of i probably got some of these things by my mother, Who might miight have ADHD-PI. I look up on the internet and not a lot of people have diagnosed with adhd have these things i say if i saw right. Instead i think generally does not shut up etc. Or not exactly have no sense of self,aphantasia or anhedona since all of their life.

I know adhd is a not a fixed, one thing applies to all others kind of disorder. But i can't see someone relating to me So i still think i might have it. I relate to a lot of symptoms. Like rocking back and forth,nd talking patterns etc, but it might not the cause of these problems.

So, Let's say i have DPDR.I saw people relating to my problems but i dont relate to dpdr symptoms a lot. And again if i got it right, people who have dpdr have it like episodic or/and have it by starting with some known cause like weed/trauma etc. i had my problems all my life.

About dpdr symptoms and not relating to it; if i have dpdr, i probably have depersonalization, but i still don't relate some said symptoms as: Warped sense of time and space, sense of disconnection like 3rd person view or feeling like watching your life on tv, visiual snow etc. Instead everythink is 4k and real. I feel not aware of it when i am interacting with others though. Or when i *image think* i start to constantly move around, get up from my chair and contantly switch rooms, and i realize when its over. or stop imagining for a moment and realize and continue imagining.

This it for now. If you have questions, i will try to answer it when i see. If you can help, thank you. And below this i will info dump some things that might help.

1. I'm 18 y/o boy, living in a *not a good* country or/and not a good place, not usa or europe or asia
2. i still live with my parents who i dont like and is actually abusive and ignorant. but i have plans for long term for getting my life good i hope.
3. i dont remeber my childhood except max 20 memories but i dont remember a trauma either.
4. im probably very depressed but cant tell the difference becasue i was always like this all my life
5. i live to my parents religion even if my religion is different.
6. i dont remember single affectionate moment in my life with my parents, mother, or anyone,so i might have emotional problems because of that but/and/or i started rejecting incoming affection from my parents some time on my life.

&#x200B;

So really in the end. I just want a wholesome, good life lived with *hopefully*  *my future* partner that compatible with me and die together. But to find her and to actually be able to live things i need to be a human again or the first time so if you help me thanks!!",False,False,"Please. Help Me Identify My Problems' Causes.

Chat GPT has helped emotionally.

So I got into a fight with my wife and started thinking about my personal feelings. How I've suppressed so many emotions and thoughts and that my anxiety is a hell of a lot worse than I thought.

But for some reason asking gpt questions about things like emotions depression and anxiety is a lot easier than even asking my therapist. I'm grateful that it reminds me that it's an AI and has no emotion and I should talk to a professional which I have been. But I've brought things up to chat gpt that I wouldn't tell my therapist because I thought it was wrong or I would be judged. I've can't remember the last time I've spoken up because I was afraid of the worst thing happening but AI has helped.

I suggest anyone who's like me and just has questions, use chat gpt for answers but do seek professional help like it suggests.


I dont know why but I feel like I had to make the post in case anyone is out there having issues with feelings and If it helped me I think it'll help.

* Need to read/listen/see multiple times to understand what is present to me.
   * Reading textbooks for instance, even if I'm familiar with the technical terms and conceptual basis, I'll have struggle understanding the intention of the writer.
   * Wouldn't be able to comprehend the speech of people at the first time and would ask them to repeat what they were talking about either because I forgotten or I didn't understand what they were talking.
* I'm having hard-time finding the motivation to do anything except when there is a tangible danger behind not doing it and this danger is very near.
   * Like the approaching deadlines of assignments or exams.
   * When the topic in discussion is related to personal affiliations in my life, say, the topic I'm studying is directly related to the survival of my loved one or a (possible) of which I perceive as romantic partner ""instructs"" me to do that boring job. I would do it even if the dangerous deadline isn't near. To attain their affection or validation I suppose.
   * I will be from time to time contemplating the meaning of life, the value of my life and thinking in an over-pragmatic thought process that is ending up as a false coping mechanism that would further worsens the case of my procrastination.
* I work in bursts of short motivation phases before a higher dopaminergic activity overrides or the motivation or the perceivable meaning of the objectively meaningful activity I was doing had ran out
   * NOT burning out but an utter void of any real motivation for engaging with the subject or even the initiation of it.
* It's all grey to me. With all honesty, I'm forgetting the last time I felt genuinely happy because of an accomplishment. Only thing i remember? Dreading any potential I could be fulfilling but wasted it all.
   * Rather a weird background. Maybe it's because of a tendency to get addicted to fast-fulfilling dopaminergic activities? Say video games, lately ChatGPT or porn.
* Aside from lower retention or focus span, I feel my thoughts are too fast yet empty.
   * I could be having a convo when I completed the sentence of the other person I'm having the convo with, thought about their perspective and instinctually completed it, but it may be too de-structured and empty to have no value.
   * In other words, I could mentally participate in a discussion where I have all the necessary fundamentals to draw conclusions from, yet have sorta of ""Paralysis"" where I see only the surface value and not the true essence if that makes sense. I could draw the ""hidden BUT OBVIOUS conclusions"" when I'm in showers, randomly after months.
   * The only way in which I can have a valuable and not so empty thoughts are through this randomly accumulated structured thoughts. I would find it hard to see beyond the preface value at anytime. It takes time.
* When I don't feel in danger / feel in danger I tend to procrastinate
   * When I don't feel in danger. I would think: Yes there's enough time to compensate for whatever.
   * When I feel in danger: In the middle of over-compensation while anxiety is reaching up to me, I would tend to run away mentally and virtually in social media. I would choose to not see academia posts as to not elicit my imposter syndrome.
* Ik I wrote this point twice but there was another point for this post that I kinda have forgotten after 3 seconds of brushing it off lmao
   * Ok I remembered. The tendency to over-fear failure. I'm currently in med school, pre-clinical years. In every block we partake I swear I keep fearing it could be the last or the one I fail in, since I don't really finish studying except a day or two before the exam.
      * It feels like shit in all honesty.
      * Lately, I transitioned from being apathetic about my mortality to fearing the next hour is my last hour, I don't have enough certainty that I will live tomorrow. Fortunately it is not severe anymore.

I really don't. I have a loving family, decent friends that I talk to sparingly and can sometimes be hopeful about the future. 

I also don't want to live. I hate life so much. I keep asking myself ""why do this and why do that"" and I keep coming to the same conclusion which is there is no point. I'm going to die regardless. The world is going to keep spiraling out of control regardless. Why bother? 

But, my life right now is not looking very good. I'm drowning in debt, career stress, and mental health issues. I genuinely need help, because I don't know how much longer I can keep pushing against this mental wall. I'll try to detail my current life situation as best as possible while keeping it relatively short.

About me: I'm a 26 year old, white male (latino heritage, but nobody believes me because my skin color, even though I'm proud of my heritage). I have a history of depression, anxiety, bi-polar disorder and epilepsy.

**Finances**

My income is inconsistent. I've been trying to build up freelancing as a web developer, but I can't seem to focus for longer than an hour before I get anxious, angry or distracted. I can't seem to get a full-time job because I don't have an updated portfolio - I get overcome with anxiety whenever I try to actually work on it. 

My debt is currently at $42,000 between credit cards and personal loans and my monthly expenses are around $3,300. At this point, I'm skipping my debt payments because I simply cannot afford it. The only thing I can barely scrape by is my rent and groceries, which is still over $2,000.

The weight of all this has pushed my anxiety further than I've ever felt. I'm constantly either angry, confused or exhausted from feeling anxious, which lowers my productivity.

**Mental Health**

Back in February this year, my ex-gf cheated on me while on a family cruise. Long story short, the relationship was defined by overindulgence in psychedelics and trust issues. She had a mental breakdown on the cruise after I confronted her, she stayed in Cabo, mexico and a week later threatened to kill me. I was in a state of shock and became addicted to ketamine which I've thankfully gotten out of, because I was starting to have some really schizophrenic thoughts (I thought I was demonically possessed, and she was a witch). 

**Career**

I have no idea where to take my career. Witnessing and interacting with all these new AI tools (midjourney, chatgpt, etc.) has really changed my perspective on my own career longevity. It sucks that I'm not inspired right now because I was incredibly passionate about making websites and now I just get incredibly anxious before working on anything that leads me to falling into ""coping with my emotions"" through video games and weed. 

For now I'm just working on two freelance projects that are relatively low price that I need to finish by the end of the month so I can pay my rent. I can't seem to finish them. I'm so tired.

**Conclusion**

This is my rock bottom. I feel an overwhelming pressure to give up. I don't want to ask for help, my family has helped enough for most of my life. This isn't their responsibility. 

I have to decide for myself to help myself, and I'm at the weakest point in my life on a mental, emotional and physical level, so it's proving incredibly difficult. 

I'm not sure what I need. Maybe I just need to hear the right words. Some inspiration perhaps. I don't know anymore. I'm confused, angry, ashamed, and mentally drained. Maybe if I stayed in college instead of dropping out, things would be different, but I made my bed and now I have to sleep in it.

Again, I don't want to kill myself, but I keep having these mental visuals where I'm doing it, almost like I'm trying to convince myself to do it.  I'm scared that if things don't change in the next couple weeks when the collectors start calling and I can't pay my bills, I'm going to get more desperate. I'd rather end it all versus going homeless or having to go to my family for help again. 

**TL;DR**

My negligent lifestyle, procrastination and mental health has led me to a point in life where I'm doing terribly financially (debt, high monthly expenses, no consistent income), career wise (no motivation, lack of action, constantly getting distracted, overwhelmed by the numerous paths I can take) & mentally (cripping anxiety, fear of losing my mind, ADHD peaking). I'm desperately fighting the suicidal thoughts, but I feel like I'm drowning in the middle of the ocean with no one else in site and my body is getting so tired.",False,False,I don't want to die or live.

And if you \[do\] go to talk to others, understand, that they are not obligated to listen to you or be there for you"".**

This is the top incarnation of a message I've been getting so many times: don't talk about your mental issues, you're a burden, they've all pressurised me to be silent. But I can't process it myself and this idiot also admitted she's got decent support! Alright, one did tell me she'll listen. After not getting a reaction to my suicidal thoughts for half an hour, it turned out she was busy watching a series. So, I think I can say now that this basic self-help advice: talk to a friend is bollocks.

And that concluded the little shatters of support network I have left. I can't get therapy because stupid state bureaucracy / general lack of therapists and can't afford private. My parents with whom this failure of an adult still lives with have always silenced me when I try to talk about my worries so that as a teenager I considered it really shameful. I've been hospitalised due to depression for 5 times now and I take more antidepressants than anyone I know.

And yet again (those suicidal cries for help are getting f\*\*\*\*\* boring for me) I just want to DIE, to end this constant cycle of suffering that only varies in the amount of emotional pain I got. I'm single, unemployed (only my stupid country thinks I am able to work not giving me benefits), lonely as hell, long-term school-bullying trauma, depression for 9 consecutive years (not counting the teenage depression), so **no, it doesn't get better!** It gets worse, I've sought all the therapy I can get and during the time of having a therapist I can somehow manage but then they leave the damn country and I am alone again and I have no-one to talk to and I get more and more unmotivated to do anything. Hotlines are crap, once the lady tried to guilt-trip me about my family so no, not doing that again.

I gave away my means for a method, for ""safety"" reasons (and they have a real-life use too), how stupid I was! Now I'm just googling what could I still do to end this miserable trainwreck of a life, for once I wish I gather the courage and not seek some useless ""help"" (tho here I am, right?).
